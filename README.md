The process involves cleaning and integrating data from various sources, then visualizing it through interactive dashboards.


### Key features include: 

- Overview Dashboard: Summarizes total call volume, AHT, FCR, and CSAT.
- Trend Analysis: Tracks call volumes and performance metrics over time.
- Agent Performance Dashboard: Assesses individual agent metrics, highlighting top and bottom performers.
